We performed the data analysis using Google Colab, utilizing the 
Python programming language. The following Python libraries were used in this project:
1. Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
2. NumPy – for numerical operations
3. Matplotlib – for creating static visualizations
4. Seaborn – for advanced and attractive data visualizations
